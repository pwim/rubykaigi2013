title: 'If you do not enter the tiger''s cave, you will not catch its cub: Objects,
  DCI, and Programming'
description: As the responsibility of our applications grows, so too does our code.
  We'll walk through techniques of object-oriented programming that help clarify our
  intent and put responsibilities right where we need them.
notes: |-
  I plan to dive into DCI and how it can help us make sense of our programs. We'll look at why we'd use an idea like DCI and explore the problems that we run into choosing Ruby as our language for it.
  I've given a similar presentation at Wroclove.rb in Wroclaw, Poland (http://storify.com/saturnflyer/wroclove-rb) and I am writing Clean Ruby (http://clean-ruby.com)

    to speak like the locals.
