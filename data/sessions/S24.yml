  Origami and the Ruby programming language have a lot more in common than having Japanese roots. This talk will make parallels between the two with the goal of presenting various techniques at becoming a better artist of code.
notes: This talk is new and specifically written for this conference. I feel like
  the topic is perfect for the RubyKaigi audience. This will be a great session because
  I'm really enthusiastic about both coding and origami. I feel like under the surface
  both of these things have complimented each other to help me become a better programmer
  and I wish to share this. I've previously spoken at local ruby user groups on complex
  topics such as using Ragel in Ruby (where I did live coding). I plan to include
  live folding with my presentation to emphasize points in the talk. I also have been
  learning Japanese for some time and while not fluent I hope to include Japanese
  text on my slides. どうもありがとうございます！
