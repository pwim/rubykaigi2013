title: 'Torquebox: When Java Became Cool Again'
description: |-
  An introduction to Torquebox (http://torquebox.org/), a JRuby Application Server, which bridges between Ruby's clean DSLs and Java's robust libraries to provide high-speed and reliable caching, messaging, background tasks and more in a single deployment.

  If you're tired of installing a bunch of projects (web server, memcache, redis, messaging, etc) just to run a single app, Torquebox is for you.
notes: |-
  The Java web landscape is very deep, this talk will mostly be a surface discussion of the common web-app issues and how they can be solved in JRuby with Torquebox.

  Not sure if this is a new topic, I've seen some slidedecks online by the developers of the project. I'm not a member of the torquebox team, but I'm using it in production and quite enjoy it.

  I've spoken locally at web-developer groups and at the JQuery conference. I'm primarily a front-end developer now days, but I've got 15 years backend experience and use Ruby (JRuby) for all my personal projects.

  bio: While I work primarily as a frontend developer these days, my heart has always
    been with Ruby. I created and run Middleman, a popular ruby-based static website
    generator and use Ruby for all my personal project. You can catch me complaining
    about Javascript on twitter, most days.
