title: Live Coding with Ben
description: "This speaker believes that the best way for programmers to learn is
  to watch each other work. \n\nThis talk leaves slides behind and focuses instead
  on the greater information density achieved through live coding.\n\nWe'll discuss
  the strengths and weaknesses of real code, and refactor it right on-stage. As we
  do so, we'll bump into lots of meaty topics:\n\n* Potential downfalls of the 'extract
  module' refactoring (aka ActiveSupport::Concern).\n* The pros and cons of Dependency
  Injection.\n* How two good OO design ideas (like SRP and Tell Don't Ask) can contradict
  each other, and what to do about it.\n* How well-placed functional programming can
  improve a codebase.\n* Whether the Law of Demeter should be followed religiously,
  and what it means if that's hard to do.\n* Why fast tests are usually good tests,
  and vice-versa.\n\nAudience participation is strongly encouraged, as is stealing
  the speaker's vim tricks for your own use. "
notes: "Hi conference organizers! \n\nThis talk is a great fit for RubyKaigi because
  it's going to be great :)\n\nHere are some tweets after recent talks that I gave:\n\n\"Very
  good presentation. Lots of good info.\" - Michael Feathers - https://twitter.com/mfeathers/status/268353914599010304\n\n\"@r00k
  is holding up well under pressure in his refactoring talk.\" - Jim Weirich - https://twitter.com/jimweirich/status/218732681658245122\n\n\"Damn,
  @r00k is going to be hard to follow.\" - Jeff Casimir - https://twitter.com/#!/j3/status/183623702871687168\n\nIf
  you plan to accept my talk, please know I have two important requests:\n\n1. This
  is a live-coding talk, so it's particularly important that I be able to test my
  laptop with the exact projector I'll be using when speaking. Ideally, you'll let
  me do this the day before speaking. Much less ideally, the morning of my talk.\n\nSince
  I can't fall back to slides, and I can't use someone else's computer (due to environment
  differences), this is really important.\n\n2. I'll need either a lapel, or headset
  microphone. I need both hands free to type. A mic mounted on a lectern won't work,
  since I'll sometimes move out to address the audience.\n\nI know organizing a conference
  means you have hundreds of to-dos, but without these things I can't give a great
  talk. Thanks for understanding! "
