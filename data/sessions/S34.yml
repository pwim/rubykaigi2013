title: Rapid development of enterprise web apps with Netzke
description: Netzke is a library that allows creating full-featured client-server
  GUI components - such as data grids, forms, windows, trees, etc - which then can
  be easily used as building blocks for complex enterprise applications. It uses Ruby
  on Rails at the server-side, and Sencha Ext JS in the browser. The choice of Ext
  JS provides for consistent look and feel, as well as for painless reusability of
  third-party Netzke components. Most importantly, Netzke allows for writing clean
  and highly maintainable code, which almost doesn't grow with the number of data
  models being used. After a brief introduction to the basics of Netzke design, a
  live coding session will be held to show how to build an example of a fairly complex
  back-end application with Netzke - by almost exclusively writing Ruby code.
notes: I have spoken about Netzke at the latest RubyConf Taiwan, and it was very well
  received, with Matz and others from the Ruby team giving their positive feedback
  and expressing their wish to see a talk about Netzke at RubyKaigi. I decided I'd
  keep my introductory, "theoretical" part as brief as possible, and focus on showing
  some cool code instead. This way it'll be easier for the majority of Japanese attendants
  to follow (I don't mean to offend anyone here!) Also, it will be a completely new
  talk, with a demo application crafted exclusively for RubyKaigi.
