title: Paired ruby
description: Pair programming shares a similar philosophy with Ruby- the focus is
  on  people solving problems for other people, not the machine. I want to share my
  experiences with pair programming and how it helped me become a better engineer,
  enjoy coding more, and maybe even grow as a person.
notes: I am a developer at Pivotal Labs where we write ruby in a pair programming
  setup full time. When I started, it completely transformed the way that I do development,
  and I would love to share that experience with other engineers. I haven't given
  this topic at a large conference yet, but I have given it at several local ruby
  user groups in my area where it is always positively received. I think it would
  be interesting for RubyKaigi since I don't see that many process talks- most of
  them are fairly technical, so this might be a refreshing change. I also think the
  unique angle that I bring to the topic of pair programming is that I feel like it
  can be a powerful method of self-improvement.
