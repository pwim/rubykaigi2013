title: 'Webruby: Now you can write your favorite Ruby code for the browser!'
description: Webruby uses emscripten to compile mruby, the lightweight Ruby implementation
  into pure JavaScript. This allows programmers to write Ruby code and run it in the
  browser. What's more, we also built a JavaScript calling interface from Webruby,
  and an OpenGL ES 2.0 binding. While naturally suited for building Web-based games,
  Webruby also provides an alternative for modern single-page applications without
  using JavaScript.
notes: |-
  Webruby is a project created by me since November 2012. It is such a new project, that it has not been talked at any Ruby conference. Webruby is different from Opal or other Ruby to JavaScript compiler, since it uses exactly the mruby implementation. If a programmer is creating a mruby project on iOS, he / she should expect the same Ruby source code can also be used on Webruby(except for some iOS specific libraries). Personally, I think this is a very interesting topic for RubyKaigi.
  I've never spoken at a conference, I would really appreciate it if you can give me the chance to talk at RubyKaigi:)

  bio: Despite an experience of writing G-BASIC on NES-compatible systems in primary
    school, my programming life really starts when I got a Chinese version of SICP.
    As a Lisp fan, I found much joy playing with Ruby later and fell in love with
    it:)
