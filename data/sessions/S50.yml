title: Beyond Ruby
description: |-
  Ruby is the most flexible language out there, imposing no limitations on the
  developers, giving all the expressiveness possible. Or so we think. But there
  are languages pushing dynamic features and expressiveness far beyond what is
  possible in Ruby. Some are old, like Lisp and Smalltalk, some are just
  emerging, purely experimental languages, like Ioke or Newspeak. In this talk,
  we will take a look at some of these languages and what they can do that Ruby
  can't. What does it mean, to be homoiconic? How does a language without
  keywords work? Can I dispatch in more than one direction? And what is partial
  evaluation?
notes: |-
  I think for every developer out there it is important to broaden the horizon,
  learn about patterns and abstractions other developers came up with, no matter
  if it was 40 years ago or just the other day. Ruby developers often assume
  they reached the top of what is possible, and honestly, they aren't doing that
  bad, but there is more out there, far more. Things Ruby as a language and we
  as developers can learn from.
