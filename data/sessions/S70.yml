title: Casual Log Collection and Querying with fluent-plugin-riak
description: |-
  Introduction to Riak as log storage and querying logs.
  Fluentd is casual, easy daemon to collect and aggregate logs from many servers,
  many daemons. In popular use cases, fluentd outputs collected log to HDFS, S3 or MongoDB.
  Riak is scalable and casual distributed key value store with rich query interface,
  and easy to operate, scale, manage and query.
  Useful logging patters and query tools in Ruby-ish way will also be introduced.
notes: |-
  Backend problem!
  Riak will solve users' scalability and operation complexity problem in a solid way -
  but weak in query language. Data insert is good by using fluentd, but querying via JavaScript (or via Erlang) is rather hard for lazy programmers; JavaScript is sometimes too flexible for us. Ruby fits well in this case of "query expression" problem.

  Also, Ruby is one of main language in Basho (Java, Erlang, Ruby client is mainstream for Riak). Many tools are written in Ruby inside, and open-srouced tools. (see github.com/basho)
  Basho is going to sponsor RubyKaigi :)
spoken_language: I can speak either. Just prefer Japanese.

  bio: |
    Working on distributed systems for 5 years, including C, C++, Erlang and Ruby.
    Had been wasted his life for memory management, multi-threading, native code compilation
    and segmentation fault. Erlang and LL is best combination for his life -
    solid but hard language for backend middleware, like Erlang
    and flexible and comprehensive language for frontend, like Ruby or Python.
    In Japan it is not so popular, but Basho is heavy user of Ruby,
    and thus HE IS trying to be Rubyist.
