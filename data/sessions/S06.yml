title: Fewer Constraints, More Concurrency.
description: Traditional data structures like stacks and queues are strict - perhaps
  too strict. In this talk I will showcase some classical data structures and then
  provide alternative constraints that will allow our algorithms to achieve a greater
  level of concurrency. Examples will include a mix of Ruby and Postgres.
notes: 'Developers like hearing about scalable systems. We all have a desire to build
  high traffic/ large data applications. This talk prepares developers for the challenges
  in building aforementioned systems. The talk combines ideas from computer science
  and real world examples. I have spoken at: RailsConf, NordicRuby, GoRuCo, Waza,
  Postgres West, FrozenRails, Dreamforce, and many local user groups. I have presented
  to Matz on the topic of Ruby limitations when he visited the Heroku office this
  year. I also am author of queue_classic which employes many of the concepts highlighted
  in the talk.'
