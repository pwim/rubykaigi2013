title: Refining refinements
description: |
  Refinements have been introduced in Ruby 2.0.  However, they are experimental, and some of the features have been removed from Ruby 2.0.0.  This talk explains the current features of Refinements, their limits, and how to refine Refinements themselves in Ruby 2.1.
notes: Refinements are half baked in Ruby 2.0, so more work is needed.  It would be
  nice to have a presentation about Refinements at RubyKaigi in order to motivate
  myself and other people who have concerns.
