title: Shrink to Grow
description: |-
  Ruby has grown in the last 20 years. The feature-set and field of usage has increased. But also the code-size has reached an exceptional size. For many systems Ruby is nowadays to large.

  To reach new systems we have to re-think the way we implement Ruby. We have to shrink Ruby to be able to grow into a new field with an army of small devices.

  This talk will cover the development of mruby. The current state of the implementation and the reason why you should contribute to it.
notes: |-
  Due to the reason that this years RubyKaigi is rebooting this conference again, it might be interesting to talk about rebooting Ruby to reach a new field too. Presenting a new implementation of Ruby which will open new fields would do this very well. mruby is also still young and needs more people for contribution. This talk tries also to recruit new contributors.

  This session will be great because it will show the usage of Ruby in a completely new fields. People might be surprised and excited that you can control hardware easily with Ruby. They might also be interested that you can compile Ruby to C code and embed it into existing applications. Or run Ruby even without an Operating System.

  I gave talks before at RubyKaigi, RubyWorld Conf, EuRuKo and Germany.rb.
