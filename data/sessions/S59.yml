title: You have to test multiple versions of your gem's dependencies. You used Appraisal.
  It's super affective!
description: So, it seems like you've finished writing your awesome gem. However,
  are you sure that your gem is working perfectly against multiple versions of its
  dependency? Are you sure that you didn't break any backward compatibility? In this
  talk, I'm going to show you the approach we have been taken to test our gems against
  multiple versions of dependencies, such as testing against Rails 3.2 and Rails 3.1.
  I'm also going to introduce you to our gem called "Appraisal" which helps you generating
  Gemfiles to be used with Bundler, and also guide it to running your test suite against
  those multiple Gemfiles. Lastly, I'm going to show you how you can config Travis
  CI to test your gem against those multiple versions of dependencies.
notes: |-
  I've been contributing to several open source projects for about 4 years now. For the last several years, I've also be working on thoughtbot's open source projects. I've found out that it's challenging to maintain our gem, such as Paperclip (file attachment management for Ruby on Rails), against multiple version of Ruby on Rails, which is its main dependencies.

  At first, we were only testing our gem against one version of Rails, just like normal people would do. After a while, we will update our gem to be working with newer version of Rails without knowing that we broke a compatibility against the previous version. Then, after Carl and Yehuda released Bundler, we realized that we can write a wrapper around Bundler to generate Gemfile and tell bundler to use the right set of gems to run your test.

  I think this talk fits with RubyKaigi since I think a lot of people who has contributed to open source project will be joining this event. I think this topic is very benefiting for them, as I want them to know that there's a tool available to help them easily test their library against multiple versions of their dependencies. I never give a talk in this topic before, but I think it will be very intersting.

  For me, I've been providing an opening keynote for Thailand Next Web Apps in 2008, which I organized that event myself (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4gmtBxegnA, my appeance is around 1:00 minute in). I've also spoken about Ruby in Barcamp Bangkok in 2010 (http://www.slideshare.net/sikachu/10-things-you-should-know-about-ruby) in order to spread the word about Ruby to developers in Bangkok. Recently, I've also spoken at BostonRB here in Boston about Rails 4 (http://bostonrb.org/presentations/what-to-expect-in-rails-40). I never spoken in any regional event before, but I think I'll be able to handle it just fine.

  Aside from the talks, I'm pretty well-known after I've been contributing to several open source projects such as Ruby on Rails (http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/prem-sichanugrist/commits). You can find me on GitHub here: https://github.com/sikachu
